## Session 6: Fix Async Future Warnings (2024-11-30)

### Issue Analyzed

User reported "Suspended async sub lost its returning future" warnings when running streaming example:
```
./bin/pagi-server --app examples/02-streaming-response/app.pl
PAGI Server listening on http://127.0.0.1:5000/
Suspended async sub PAGI::Server::Connection::_handle_request lost its returning future at lib/PAGI/Server/Connection.pm line 124.
Suspended async sub CODE(0x7fb6f3238850) in package PAGI::Server::Connection lost its returning future at lib/PAGI/Server/Connection.pm line 213.
```

### Root Causes Identified

1. **`_handle_request` Future not tracked**: The async `_handle_request` was called without storing its returned Future. When the Connection object was garbage collected, the pending Future caused the warning.

2. **Orphaned `$receive->()` Futures**: When apps call `$receive->()` to monitor for disconnect, the returned Future could be orphaned when the app finishes successfully before disconnect occurs. The async sub inside `_create_receive` was left awaiting `$receive_pending`.

### Fixes Applied

1. **Track `_handle_request` Future**: Store in `request_future` field and call `->retain` to prevent GC during processing.

2. **Track receive Futures**:
   - Added `receive_futures` array to track all Futures returned by `$receive->()`
   - Changed `_create_receive` to return a regular sub wrapper that tracks Futures
   - In `_close()`, complete all pending receive Futures with disconnect event

### Test Results

All tests pass with no warnings:
```
prove -l t/
All tests successful.
Files=10, Tests=23
```

Manual testing with streaming example:
- No warnings on request completion
- Multiple requests work correctly
- Clean shutdown

   - Updated on_read handler to notify pending receive Futures

3. **Added parse_chunked_body() to Protocol::HTTP1**
   - Parses chunked Transfer-Encoding body format
   - Returns decoded data, bytes consumed, and completion flag
   - Handles chunk extensions (stripped)

4. **Fixed examples/03-request-body/app.pl**
   - Changed return statement to `\&app;` for proper `do` loading

5. **Created comprehensive t/03-request-body.t tests**

   - Chunked Transfer-Encoding decoding test

### Test Results

All tests pass:
```
prove -l t/
All tests successful.
Files=10, Tests=23
```

### Features Marked as Passing (14/75)

New features passing (5 new):
- Client disconnect detection stops the streaming app
- Request body handling - 03-request-body app echoes POST body
- GET request without body receives empty body event
- Large request body arrives as multiple http.request events
- Chunked Transfer-Encoding on request body works correctly

### Key Code Changes

   - Use Protocol::WebSocket for frame parsing/building
   - Implement websocket.connect, websocket.accept, websocket.send, websocket.close events

---

## Session 4: Step 2 - Streaming Responses (2024-11-30)

### Completed Tasks

1. **Implemented Streaming Response Support**
   - Chunked Transfer-Encoding for responses without Content-Length
   - Multiple `http.response.body` events with `more => 1` flag
   - Proper termination with final chunk `0\r\n\r\n`

2. **Implemented HTTP Trailers Support**
   - Added `trailers => 1` flag in `http.response.start`
   - Added `http.response.trailers` event handling
   - Trailers sent after final body chunk per HTTP/1.1 spec
   - Format: `0\r\n<trailer-name>: <value>\r\n\r\n`

3. **Fixed Disconnect Handling**
   - `_create_receive()` now properly waits on pending Future for disconnect
   - `_handle_disconnect()` completes pending futures instead of returning early
   - `_close()` calls `_handle_disconnect()` before closing stream

4. **Fixed examples/02-streaming-response/app.pl**
   - Changed return statement to `\&app;` for proper `do` loading

5. **Created t/02-streaming.t**
   - 4 subtests covering streaming functionality
   - Tests chunked encoding, multiple body chunks, trailers body content
   - Uses Net::Async::HTTP (trailers verified manually with curl)

### Test Results

All tests pass:
```
prove -l t/
All tests successful.
Files=10, Tests=18
```

### Features Marked as Passing (9/75)

New features passing:
- Streaming response with multiple chunks - 02-streaming-response app
- HTTP trailers are transmitted after streaming body

### Key Code Changes

**lib/PAGI/Server/Connection.pm:**
- `_create_send()`: Added `$expects_trailers` and `$body_complete` state tracking
- `http.response.body`: Don't send final terminator if trailers expected
- `http.response.trailers`: Send `0\r\n` + headers + `\r\n`
- `_create_receive()`: Wait on pending Future for disconnect events
- `_handle_disconnect()`: Complete pending futures properly

### Technical Notes

- Net::Async::HTTP doesn't expose HTTP trailers, so trailer content verified with curl
- Raw socket tests block IO::Async event loop - avoided in favor of HTTP client
- `watch_disconnect()` pattern in example app monitors for client disconnect during streaming

### Next Steps for Future Sessions

1. **Step 3: Request Body Handling** (next priority)
   - Support POST/PUT with request body
   - Multiple `http.request` events for large bodies
   - Chunked request body de-chunking

### Test Results

All tests continue to pass:
```
prove -l t/
All tests successful.
Files=10, Tests=14
```
